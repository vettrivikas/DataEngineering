Chapter 1: What is MongoDB?
____________________________

MongoDB stores data in BSON and you can then view it in JSON. 
BSON is faster to parse and lighter to store than JSON.
JSON supports fewer data types than BSON.

In MongoDB how does a document relate to a collection?

answer: Collections consist of one or many documents.

In a MongoDB Document what is the role of fields and values?


Answer :Each field has a value associated with it.

        A field is a unique identifier for a specific datapoint.

Chapter 3: Creating and Manipulating Documents
_______________________________________________

Quiz:How does the value of _id get assigned to a document?
Answer: 
        You can select a non ObjectId type value when inserting a new document, as long as that value is unique to this document.
        It is automatically generated as an ObjectId type value.

Quiz: Insert Error 
      Select all true statements from the following list:

Answer: MongoDB can store duplicate documents in the same collection, as long as their _id values are different.
        If a document is inserted without a provided _id value, then the _id field and value will be automatically generated for the inserted document before           insertion.


Quiz: Insert Order

Quiz: Upsert

        How does the upsert option work?
        Answer:

        When upsert is set to false and the query predicate returns an empty cursor then there will be no updated documents as a result of this operation.
        When upsert is set to true and the query predicate returns an empty cursor, the update operation creates a new document using the directive from the query predicate and the update predicate.
